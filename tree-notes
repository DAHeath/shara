A reasonable strategy just invokes the iZ3 tree interpolation algorithm when
the current subproblem happens to be treelike.  A problem is treelike when
there is no uninterpolated predicate with multiple predecessors.  This should
be relatively easy to recognize.  When this occurs, stop cutting the grammar
and instead just solve it all once with the tree interpolator.
